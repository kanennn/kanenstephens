-   unofficial, unprofessional, unfiltered

-   raw regular content straight from my sole

-   combatting polish and posh that strangles transparency, creativity, authenticity, and spontaneity

-   treeish, organic, a little granola-girl-esque, and spunky

-   no fear, no masking, no perfectionism, no embarrassment, no mirroring, no hiding, no culling, no only-the-best-of-me stuff. only messy reality, real people, real connection, real stuff, real art, real fun

-   a fun, charming, personal, silly enclave to share my personal tidbits, humor, and experiences

-   capturing the feeling of inviting your friends into your messy bedroom, even though you feel bad about it, jumping on the bed, staying up too late, making jokes you probably shouldn't and losing your minds _(together)_

-   there is no consistency, there is no standard. there is no right or wrong. there is only creativity, fun, and shitposting

-   in essence, a dumpster fire i started and keep fueling because i am insane and am having so much fun. and you're all here just watching

# Why a manifesto?

I make a manifesto for some of my projects so I can keep up with the spirit of the project.

for this project specifically, i am aiming to be more raw and fun than some of my others. this manifesto is there to remind me of the values of this site, so i don't get stuck in a suit-and-tie mindset that i may have elsewhere while creating content here.
